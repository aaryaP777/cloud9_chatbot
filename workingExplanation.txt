1. chatbot_engine.py → Building the Knowledge Base

You have a text file sample_logs.txt with cloud/security events (EC2 CPU spike, IAM role modified, etc.).
Each line of this file is turned into a document.
These documents are converted into embeddings using Cohere’s embedding model "embed-english-v3.0".
Embeddings = numerical vectors that capture the meaning of text.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) stores these vectors in a vector database (vector_store/).
This allows fast “find similar documents” when a user asks a question.
👉 So this step is about preparing memory for your chatbot.

2. app.py → Serving User Queries

The user sends a question through the frontend (/chat endpoint).
Backend (app.py) does:
Takes the user’s query (e.g., “why budget spurred last month”).
Embeds it (same way as before) and searches in FAISS for the most similar logs (similarity_search)
Example: finds “CloudFront cost increased by 40% …”.
Builds a prompt that combines:
The matched context (logs)
The user’s question
A fixed instruction ("You are an assistant helping with cloud optimization and security…").
Sends this final prompt to Cohere’s command-r-08-2024 model via the Chat API.
Gets back a natural language answer and returns it to the frontend.
👉 This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
FAISS = retrieval (fetching relevant logs)
Cohere command-r = generation (turning logs + question into an answer)

3. Frontend (React) → User Interface

Shows the conversation (user messages + bot responses).
Sends the query to FastAPI, gets back a response, and displays it.
👉 This is the chat window where everything comes together.
